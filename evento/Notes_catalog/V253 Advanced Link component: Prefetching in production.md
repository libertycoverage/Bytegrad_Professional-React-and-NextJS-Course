## V253 Advanced Link Component: Prefetching In Production
Description: In production (NOT in development) the `<Link />` component will prefetch the page / route that it is linking to when it is in view. It will receive the React Server Component payload (RSC payload) -- which is just the result of rendering a server component -- and put it in the client-side cache (router cache).



If we click around, we will find that application (after `npm run build` & `npm run start`) is much faster in general, because one other thing that is also enabled in production (we are running a production build) is that these `<Link />`s (as on "All Events" page) components that we have been using e.g. in the `events-list.tsx` we are using `EventCard` component -> `event-card.tsx` here we are using `Link` component from Next.js `const MotionLink = motion(Link);` (we are using Framer Motion but it is still `Link` component under the hood).

What that will do in production is when it is in the view ("All Events" page), it will actually prefetch, it will actually fetch them (`Link`s) from the server even though we haven't clicked them yet but it will already fetch the result of the server components. Then when we click on them, they will be there waiting for us in the Router Cache (in that client-side cache).

We can observe that in the Network tab in dev tools in Chrome, as we scroll down e.g. `http://localhost:3000/events/all?page=1` we can see new network request for certain resources, (we need to use `npm run build` & `npm run start` for production server). Even for terms and conditions and privacy policy, which we have on the bottom of the page, these also a `Link` components. Next.js will already fetch basically everything, so when we go there it is super fast, already waiting for us.

We could make the argument that these pages that are statically build using `slug`s with `generateStaticParams()` (`slug: "comedy-extravaganza"`, `slug: "dj-practice-session"`), these will be created during the build, so that is optimal, but also during production, in case we did not do that, when we have them in the view (we see "All Events" page in the browser), if we use `Link` component it, the website that the `Link` is pointing to will already be prefetched in the background as well.



### Router Cache as a client-side cache

In Next.js, the router cache can refer to several different caching mechanisms related to routing, which can involve both client-side and server-side caching strategies. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Client-Side Caching**:
   - **Next.js Link Prefetching**: When using the `Link` component from `next/link`, Next.js can automatically prefetch the linked page’s JavaScript and data during idle time, resulting in faster page transitions. This is a form of client-side caching.
   - **Browser Cache**: The browser caches static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) and API responses based on HTTP headers. Next.js can set these headers to control caching behavior.

2. **Server-Side Caching**:
   - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages generated at build time are served from the server cache, making the initial load faster.
   - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Allows you to create or update static pages after you’ve built your site. When a request comes in, if the page is stale (based on a revalidation time), Next.js regenerates it in the background and updates the cache.

3. **Edge Caching**:
   - **CDN**: Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) cache static assets and pages close to the end-user. This reduces latency and speeds up page load times. Next.js integrates well with CDNs like Vercel’s Edge Network.

#### Router Cache in Context
If by "router cache" you are specifically referring to the cache involved in routing and page transitions handled by Next.js, it primarily involves client-side caching through prefetching and leveraging the browser’s cache for assets.

Here's an example of how client-side prefetching is done using the `Link` component:

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About Page</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, Next.js will prefetch the `about` page during idle time, storing it in the client-side cache for faster transitions.

#### Conclusion
While the router cache can involve client-side caching mechanisms such as prefetching and browser cache, it also ties into server-side and edge caching strategies for optimal performance in a Next.js application.
