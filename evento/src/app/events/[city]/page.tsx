// V211
// 1) We want to have centered `H1` in EventsPage, let's do that with flexbox className `flex`;
// 2) right now we have only `H1` but we are going to have list of events also, if we use only `flex` they are going to sit next to each other horizontally,
// but we want them to be next to each other vertically (keep vertical flow), we use `flex-col`;
// 3) now we can center them horizontally with `items-center`;
// 4) Remember with flexbox we have `align-items`(y) and `justify-content`(x) and they switch (x switches with y) when you use "column flex" `flex-col`
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container
// 5) add padding both top and bottom `py-24`
// 6) also add padding horizontally when the viewport gets smaller `px-[20px]`and the content won't sit against the edge
// 7) add a scrollbar here, minimum height of the field will be 110% of the viewport `min-h-[110vh]`, there appears a scrollbar
// 8) scrollbar does not look great, let's style the scrollbar, this is a good example of something we cannot easily do in Tailwind right now
// 9) let's style the scrollbar, we can actually do that in CSS, in CSS `global.css` file we get from Next.js, this is where we should put a style for that
// (this is something we got from resources in repository to evento project;
// width; scrollbar-track it is the entire thing of scrollbar, a background; scrollbar-thumb it is the bar we click and hold when moving the scrollbar up and down;
// scrollbar-thumb:hover when we hover over thumb), for Firefox it needs to be slightly different
// --
// Give every page a scrollbar, no horizontal shift ->
// 10) Something that can be disliked when using scrollbars is the shift of the page when scrollbar appears on the side (right or left),
// that happens when you click on some other page that does not have enough content in length of the site to enable sidebar on the side and then again on the site with long-enough content.
// 11) One thing to prevent this is to give every page a scrollbar. What we can do is go to the `<body>` in layout.tsx and in there add className `overflow-y-scroll`,
// when we do that scrollbar, at least the track will appear on every page (almost not noticeable).
// Now when we switch back and forth between pages, there is no layout shift due to scroll bar.

// V212
// 1) We have a `H1` in EventsPage, we want dynamic title to show a city based on URL (URL is based on the search result). Previously we used `usePathname()` to know the active link,
// `usePathname()` will give `/events/miami`, we could use that, the downside is that it is a hook, that would mean we would have to change EventsPage to a client component (we can use this hook in a client component),
// and that is not what we want, especially on the page component, everything would be affected by that on the page.
// 2) There is another way to get URL details, we can keep this a server component, Next.js will give it in page component, this will not work on any server components, only in this page component.
// There is something called `params`, and that is what we put in square brackets in route e.g. `/events/[city]`. We get params as a prop.
// Example -> Whatever name we are giving to square brackets in dynamic route `/events/[name]/` catalog, when we pass `params` we may use in that component `{params.name}
// We want to type `params`, what `params` is? Here we need to look up the documentation of Next.js. "next.js params type" https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes
// 4) The downside is that city is displayed here with small case (based on city in URL, that is a small case always), we want to display city with the upper case `Events in austin`,
// if we capitalize the first character in CSS going to `H1` changing the style that would also mean that also `In` would be capitalized, and that is not what we want.
// We will capitalize the first letter of the city with JS.
// Maybe instead of working with params directly in the title it would be better to extract `const city = params.city;` and then `<H1>Events in {city}</H1>`
// We cannot use `{city.toUpperCase()}` because that would capitalize all letters to `AUSTIN`.
// We want to take first character at index zero, and that is the one we want to uppercase on (that will only produce the first character e.g. `A`),
// then we want to concatenate this one big letter with the rest of the word (slice from the first character onwards to the end of the word) `{city.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + city.slice(1)}`
// 5) Now when we go to the `http://localhost:3000/events/all`  we want to display all events but not to show title `Events inÂ All`,
// we can have conditional logic here, when the city is all `city === 'all'` we want to display `All Events` and when it is not `all` we want this condition in template literals
