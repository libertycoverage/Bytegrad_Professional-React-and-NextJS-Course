## V246 Server-Side Pagination In NextJS For EventsList (using Prisma, Radix UI) 
Description: Implement server-side pagination in Next.js.

Right now when we go to "All Events" page, we are literally getting all of the events form the database and showing them. What if we have thousands of events? We need pagination.

We can have first 6 events and the URL changes with params for the pagination, we click on the next button at the bottom of the page.

In the URL we have so called search params, there is going to be some question mark and page with the number `localhost:3000/events/all?page=2`. 

We have so called path parametres (a part of the path) e.g. `localhost:3000/events/austin`, then we have query param or search param `?page=2`,
`localhost:3000/events/austin?page=2`

How do we make  that we only see first e.g. 6 events, then we have a button to see the next page. 

We are going to implement pagination, and pagination we can do two ways essentially
1) you could get all of the data from the database, and then you can display the first 6, then you keep the other ones in memory, then when we click on "Next" button, it takes the next 6 from what we already fetched, we already have on client side. We could even use `useState()` and then take the next 6.
2) However when we have large database, like thousands of events, we don't want to get everything on the client-side, it would take up too much memory, here we want to do server-side pagination.

That server-side pagination is what we are going to do here, it should just get the first 6 from the database. How do we do that with Prisma here?

In `utils.ts` we have `getEvents()`, here whatever the result is, we are getting everything

`utils.ts` fragment
```ts
// V243 Replace Fetch API With Prisma Client
export async function getEvents(city: string) {
  //prisma.eventoEvent.findMany(); // it will actually get all of the events
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      // city city, // this solution does not work because of a lowercase city from params URL and uppercase in database
      //city: {     // this solution works
      //  equals: city,
      //  mode: "insensitive",
      //},
      //city: capitalize(city), // this solution also works, but does not for "city all"
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    }
  });
  return events;
}
```

What we can also do, it is also very easy with Prisma, we just `take: 6` results. 

`utils.ts` fragment
```ts
// V243 Replace Fetch API With Prisma Client
export async function getEvents(city: string) {
  //prisma.eventoEvent.findMany(); // it will actually get all of the events
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      // city city, // this solution does not work because of a lowercase city from params URL and uppercase in database
      //city: {     // this solution works
      //  equals: city,
      //  mode: "insensitive",
      //},
      //city: capitalize(city), // this solution also works, but does not for "city all"
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    take: 6,
  });
  return events;
}
```

It will only show 6 results, but now how do we see the other ones?
What we want to be able to do here is to add query param or search param called `page`, and we want to do e.g. `/all?page=2` 

We go to `/events/[city]/page.tsx`, here in `EventsPage` component we are already getting `params`, that is for the `city`.

In Next.js there is something called `useSearchParams()`, we can use that to get the information, but this would make it a client component (this only works in a client component). We would have to convert it into a client component, which not what we want to do, because we do not want to convert the whole page to a client component, everything would be affected by that

`/events/[city]/page.tsx` fragment
```tsx
export default async function EventsPage({
  params,
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps) {
  // ---- V238 end of block
  const city = params.city;
  useSearchParams();
```

What we can also do, we get it as a prop as well, Next.js will give it to a page component as a props, it is called `searchParams`, in our case `params` will give us `city`, `searchParams` will give us page we are currently on. We get `searchParams.page`. Where do we make the actual fetch call, that what we are going in `EventsList`, we can pass that `page` down to `EventsList`.

`/events/[city]/page.tsx` fragment
```tsx
// (...)

export default async function EventsPage({
  params, searchParams
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps) {
  const city = params.city;
  const page = searchParams.page;

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center py-24 px-[20px] min-h-[110vh]">
      <H1 className="mb-28">
        {city === "all" && "All Events"}
        {city !== "all" &&
          `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`}
      </H1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <EventsList city={city} page={page}/>
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}      
```

We open up `EventsList` `events-list.tsx`, now it will accept `page` component, `page` is actually a number 

`events-list.tsx`
```tsx
import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./event-card";
import { getEvents, sleep } from "@/lib/utils";

type EventsListProps = {
  city: string;
  page: number;
};

export default async function EventsList({ city, page }: EventsListProps) {
  await sleep(2000); 
  const events = await getEvents(city);

  console.log(events);

  return (
    <section className="max-w-[1100px] flex flex-wrap gap-10 justify-center px-[20px]">
      {events.map((event) => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}
```

If we go back to `/events/[city]/page.tsx` we have an issue here (red squiggly lines for `searchParams` props), because when we get something from the URL typically it is going to be a string. `searchParams` is not typed yet, let's  first try typing `searchParams`. Here we are using `EventsPageAndMetadataProps` props for typing props of `EventPage`. We do not want to add `searchParams` to that `EventsPageAndMetadataProps` props, then we would also have that for `generateMetadata`. Let's create a separate type again for EventsPage `EventsPageOnlyProps`. We still want `params` with the `city` from `EventsPageAndMetadataProps`, we can do that in TypeScript, take that type `EventsPageAndMetadataProps` and then add something to that `&`. 

```tsx
// we do not want that searchParams here
type EventsPageAndMetadataProps = {
  params: {
    city: string;
  };
  searchParams: {
    page: number;
  };
```

`/events/[city]/page.tsx` before change
```tsx
import EventsList from "@/components/events-list";
import H1 from "@/components/h1";
//import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
//import { sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import Loading from "./loading";
import { Metadata } from "next";
import { capitalize } from "@/lib/utils";

type EventsPageAndMetadataProps = {
  params: {
    city: string;
  };
};

export function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps): Metadata {
  const city = params.city;

  return {
    title: city === "all" ? "All Events" : `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`,
  };
}

export default async function EventsPage({
  params, searchParams
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps) {
  const city = params.city;
  const page = searchParams.page;

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center py-24 px-[20px] min-h-[110vh]">
      <H1 className="mb-28">
        {city === "all" && "All Events"}
        {city !== "all" &&
          `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`}
      </H1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <EventsList city={city} page={page}/>
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}      
```

How do we know what type of `searchParams` is going to be? This is something what was found in the Next.js documentation website `searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined };`.

`/events/[city]/page.tsx` after change
```tsx
import EventsList from "@/components/events-list";
import H1 from "@/components/h1";
//import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
//import { sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import Loading from "./loading";
import { Metadata } from "next";
import { capitalize } from "@/lib/utils";

type EventsPageAndMetadataProps = {
  params: {
    city: string;
  };
};

type EventsPageOnlyProps = EventsPageAndMetadataProps & {
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined };
}

export function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps): Metadata {
  const city = params.city;

  return {
    title: city === "all" ? "All Events" : `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`,
  };
}

export default async function EventsPage({
  params, searchParams
//}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps) {
}: EventsPageOnlyProps) {
  const city = params.city;
  const page = searchParams.page;

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center py-24 px-[20px] min-h-[110vh]">
      <H1 className="mb-28">
        {city === "all" && "All Events"}
        {city !== "all" &&
          `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`}
      </H1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <EventsList city={city} page={page}/>
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}      
```

Type for `searchParams`, It is an object, it could be some kind of `string` as a `key`, then `string`, an array of `string`s, or `undefined`, BUT NOT A NUMBER. So now when we type it like that indeed in `page` props in `EventsList`, we have an issue here `page={page}`(red squiggly lines), `page` needs to be a number. Here it is a little bit tricky, because if we have a `string`. If you can quicky convert e.g. `string` `"5"` to a `number`, you should be able to use plus on that `+5` . Unary operator it will convert `string` to a `number`. But here when we do `+page` we have an issue here because `page` could be `undefined` (intellisense), we cannot do it on `undefined`. In URL `localhost:300/events/all?page=2` we may not have anything here `?page=2`, we may also want to have this `localhost:300/events/all` - now there is no `page` search parameter - `page` here would be undefined.

```tsx
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <EventsList city={city} page={page} /> {/* V246 {page} */}
      </Suspense>
```

### important logic operators for pagination

What we could do here if `searchParams.page` is indeed undefined we can use OR operator here `const page = searchParams.page || 1;` That would mean if the `page` is undefined we get the second operand here which is `1`. If `searchParams.page` is falsy (if this is `undefined` or an empty string we will get the `1`). On downside of doing it this way `const page = searchParams.page || 1;` is that if this `searchParams.page` happens to be `0` (page zero), that is also falsy, so we get `1` as well. Maybe we do want to have `0` zero here `searchParams.page`, maybe we do want to allow zero, but now we would get `1` here, zero is considered falsy, and with OR operator we get the second operand `1`.

There is another one here `const page = searchParams.page ?? 1;`. If we would use this one, and the page is `0` zero, we would get `0` as the `page`, it will preserve zero `0`, but if it `searchParams.page` is `undefined` or `null` we would get the second operand `1`. `??` this is more strict essentially, here we only get `1` if `searchParams.page` is `undefined` or `null`.

SO we may want to use `??`, it can appear in the projects often.

In our case we may want to let OR `||`, `const page = searchParams.page || 1;`. Let's say we do not want to have page zero `0`, we always have `1` and above. If `searchParams.page` that is `undefined` just take `1`. And here  `page={+page}` we do unary operator `+`, in case if `page` is some `sting` we will convert it to a number `"5"` -> `5`.


`/events/[city]/page.tsx` after another change `page={+page}` and `const page = searchParams.page || 1;`
```tsx
import EventsList from "@/components/events-list";
import H1 from "@/components/h1";
//import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
//import { sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import Loading from "./loading";
import { Metadata } from "next";
import { capitalize } from "@/lib/utils";

type EventsPageAndMetadataProps = {
  params: {
    city: string;
  };
};

type EventsPageOnlyProps = EventsPageAndMetadataProps & {
  searchParams: { [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined };
}

export function generateMetadata({
  params,
}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps): Metadata {
  const city = params.city;

  return {
    title: city === "all" ? "All Events" : `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`,
  };
}

export default async function EventsPage({
  params, searchParams
//}: EventsPageAndMetadataProps) {
}: EventsPageOnlyProps) {
  const city = params.city;
  const page = searchParams.page || 1;

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center py-24 px-[20px] min-h-[110vh]">
      <H1 className="mb-28">
        {city === "all" && "All Events"}
        {city !== "all" &&
          `Events in ${capitalize(city)}`}
      </H1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <EventsList city={city} page={+page}/>
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}      
```


Now in `events-list.tsx` `EventsList` will receive this `page` as a prop, it is going to be a `number`. Here we are getting the events based on the city `const events = await getEvents(city);` but now we should get it based on the `city` but also the `page` `const events = await getEvents(city, page);.` Now we need to modify this utility function a little bit `getEvents()` in `utils.ts`. `getEvents()` should accept `page`

`utils.ts` fragment
```ts
export async function getEvents(city: string) {
  //prisma.eventoEvent.findMany(); // it will actually get all of the events
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      // city city, // this solution does not work because of a lowercase city from params URL and uppercase in database
      //city: {     // this solution works
      //  equals: city,
      //  mode: "insensitive",
      //},
      //city: capitalize(city), // this solution also works, but does not for "city all"
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    // V246
    take: 6,
  });
  return events;
}
```

Now we should fetch data from our database not just based on the city, but also based on what page we are on. 

What we also want to do here is define default, if we do not pass anything for `page`, we can just assume we are on the `page = 1`. This a default parameter value `page = 1`, if we do this way we do not have to type parameter either, TypeScript can infer what the type of this default value is (here `number`).

Now what we can do her in Prisma, we always want to take 6 events, but we can also `skip` some events. We do not always want to take first six, sometimes based on the `page`, we want to `skip` some. If we are on `page` 2 let's say, we should `skip` the first `6`, we can say `(page - 1) * 6`, (2 - 1) * 6 = 6, we are going to `skip` first `6`, and then `take` the `6` we get after that, we `skip` according to the formula. For `page` `3` we are going to skip first 12 etc. This is how it works for pagination. Prisma makes it easy for us with `take` and `skip`.

`utils.ts` fragment after modification
```ts
export async function getEvents(city: string, page = 1) {
  //prisma.eventoEvent.findMany(); // it will actually get all of the events
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      // city city, // this solution does not work because of a lowercase city from params URL and uppercase in database
      //city: {     // this solution works
      //  equals: city,
      //  mode: "insensitive",
      //},
      //city: capitalize(city), // this solution also works, but does not for "city all"
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    // V246
    take: 6,
    skip: (page - 1) * 6,
  });
  return events;
}
```

Now we need to make sure we pass the correct `city` and `page` to `getEvents` to get correct number of events. In `events-list.tsx` we call that `getEvents(city, page)`, we are passing `city` and `page`, we get some `events`, we `map` over `events`. 

`events-list.tsx`
```tsx
import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./event-card";
import { getEvents, sleep } from "@/lib/utils";

type EventsListProps = {
  city: string;
  page: number;
};

export default async function EventsList({ city, page }: EventsListProps) {
  await sleep(2000); 
  const events = await getEvents(city, page); //V246

  console.log(events);
  return (
    <section className="max-w-[1100px] flex flex-wrap gap-10 justify-center px-[20px]">
      {events.map((event) => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now when we refresh `localhost:3000/events/all`, we are always getting 6 events
When we use query params `localhost:3000/events/all?page=2`, we have 6 different ones on the page, the same for next pages, `localhost:3000/events/all?page=3`, `localhost:3000/events/all?page=4`, each time we get different set of events the way we want. 

The same is for Seattle end Austin e.g. (the same page `localhost:3000/events/seattle`, `localhost:3000/events/seattle?page=1`), `localhost:3000/events/seattle?page=2` etc.


### buttons for paginations

Now we need to add buttons for UI for pagination (next, previous), let's add that to `events-list.tsx`, `EventsList` is always here when we use list, this is where we will have pagination controls. We add `<PaginationControls />` inside `</section>`, we create file `pagination-controls.tsx` in `/components` catalog. In here there will be buttons.

`events-list.tsx`
```tsx
import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./event-card";
import { getEvents, sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import PaginationControls from "./pagination-controls"; // <- added V246

type EventsListProps = {
  city: string;
  page: number;
};

export default async function EventsList({ city, page }: EventsListProps) {
  await sleep(2000); 
  const events = await getEvents(city, page); //V246

  console.log(events);
  return (
    <section className="max-w-[1100px] flex flex-wrap gap-10 justify-center px-[20px]">
      {events.map((event) => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}

    <PaginationControls />
    </section>
    
  );
}
```


`pagination-controls.tsx`
```tsx
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function PaginationControls() {
  return (
    <section className="flex">
      <Link
        href="/events/austin?page=1"
        className="text-white flex items-center px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-xs"
      >
        <ArrowLeftIcon />
        Previous
      </Link>

      <Link href="/events/austin?page=3">Next
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </Link>
    </section>
  );
}
```

In `pagination-controls.tsx` we need to specify `<Link />` components for navigation, where we want to go, 
let's hardcode something first `<Link href="/events/austin?page=1"/>` 
it will be something similar to that. On page 1 there should be only one button "Next" to the next page (2nd). On page 2 there should be two `Link`s, "Previous" button to page 1 and the "Next" button to 3rd page etc.

We need to style button, so they are visible, we add `className`s, `text-white`,. we add horizontal padding `px-5`, vertical padding `py-3`, background color white with 5% opacity `bg-white/5`, we want rounded medium `rounded-md`, opacity of 75% `opacity-75`.

We want button to sit next to each other, so we make `<section>` surrounding buttons a flex container

We need to add icons to the buttons, we are going to use Radix UI
`/evento $ npm install @radix-ui/react-icons@1.3.0`

now we can use `<ArrowLeftIcon />` and `<ArrowRightIcon />` before and after the text accordingly

In the button icon and text of the button should sit next to each other, we need a `<Link>` to be `flex`, they now sit in the line. We also want to center text of the button and icon of the button vertically so the are in the same line, we can add `items-center` (near the `flex`). 
Now we want to add some space between icon and text (like a spacebar), we can say gap horizontal 2 `gap-x-2`. When we hover over button it should be normal opacity `hover:opacity-100`, that should be smooth `transition`. We also want to make text small `text-sm`

### how to avoid copying classes (className) when styling the HTML component, or a React component that will comes down to HTML component

Now we want the exact same styles for the other button as well, of course we could copy the `className`s to the other button, but that will cause 2 places we need to alter when we want to make a small change, that is suboptimal. There is a possibility that buttons will be out of sync when we make an mistake on our own.

Instead of doing it this way, what people will do is to make a component outside, e.g. `btnStyles`, and then use constant variable like this `className={btnStyles}`

`pagination-controls.tsx`
```tsx
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import Link from "next/link";

const btnStyles =
  "text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm";

export default function PaginationControls() {
  return (
    <section className="flex justify-between w-full">
      <Link
        href="/events/austin?page=1"
        // className="text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm"
        className={btnStyles}
      >
        <ArrowLeftIcon />
        Previous
      </Link>

      <Link href="/events/austin?page=3" className={btnStyles}>
        Next
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </Link>
    </section>
  );
}

```

There should be space between buttons, button should be on the sides of the page, on the parent element `<section className="flex">` we say `justify-between`. That alone did not work, pagination controls (buttons) should span the entire width itself first before the elements in there could be pushed to the sides, the element itself (`<section>`) should be the entire width `w-full`. Now we can see button are sitting on both side.

Obviously `<Link />`s have hardcoded `href` which is obviously wrong. 
Depends on the city we are on, as well as the page we are on, the next href is going to be.
The data we need we have in `events-list.tsx`, `city, page`, we could pas down `city` and `page` to `<PaginationControls />`, but does this component really needs to know about `page` and `city`? Maybe it is better to compute it in `events-list.tsx` in `EventsList` component and then pass down the paths.

Let's actually do that :
```tsx
  const previousPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}`;
  const nextPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page + 1}`;
```

then we pass that down to `<PaginationControls />`
`<PaginationControls previousPath={previousPath} nextPath={nextPath}/>`

`events-list.tsx`
```tsx
import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./event-card";
import { getEvents, sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import PaginationControls from "./pagination-controls"; // <- added V246

type EventsListProps = {
  city: string;
  page: number;
};

export default async function EventsList({ city, page }: EventsListProps) {
  await sleep(2000); 
  const events = await getEvents(city, page); //V246

  const previousPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}`;
  const nextPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page + 1}`;

  console.log(events);
  return (
    <section className="max-w-[1100px] flex flex-wrap gap-10 justify-center px-[20px]">
      {events.map((event) => (
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}

    <PaginationControls previousPath={previousPath} nextPath={nextPath}/>
    </section>
    
  );
}
```

`pagination-controls.tsx`
```tsx
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import Link from "next/link";

const btnStyles =
  "text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm";

type PaginationControlsProps = {
  previousPath: string;
  nextPath: string;
};

export default function PaginationControls({
  previousPath,
  nextPath,
}: PaginationControlsProps) {
  return (
    <section className="flex justify-between w-full">
      <Link
        // href="/events/austin?page=1"
        href={previousPath}
        // className="text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm"
        className={btnStyles}
      >
        <ArrowLeftIcon />
        Previous
      </Link>

      <Link
        //   href="/events/austin?page=3"
        href={nextPath}
        className={btnStyles}
      >
        Next
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </Link>
    </section>
  );
}
```


### removing "Previous" button form the first page

Now we have a problem, if we are on page 1 and we have a button "Previous" we can go to page 0 that does not exist. On the first page there is should be no "Previous" button. When we go to `events-list.tsx`, this `previousPath` ->
```tsx
const previousPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}`;
```
only makes sense if we are on the page bigger than 1.

Only when we are on the page that is greater than 1, if that is true we make this string, otherwise have an empty string.
```tsx
const previousPath = page > 1 ? `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}` : "";
```

so here in `pagination-controls.tsx` we can check actually if the string is empty it won't even render `<Link>` component. It should check if the `previousPath` exists, we will have this link, otherwise null. If the `previousPath` is truthy we will have this `<Link>`.

`pagination-controls.tsx`
```tsx
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import Link from "next/link";

const btnStyles =
  "text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm";

type PaginationControlsProps = {
  previousPath: string;
  nextPath: string;
};

export default function PaginationControls({
  previousPath,
  nextPath,
}: PaginationControlsProps) {
  return (
    <section className="flex justify-between w-full">
      {previousPath ? (
        <Link
          // href="/events/austin?page=1"
          href={previousPath}
          // className="text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm"
          className={btnStyles}
        >
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
          Previous
        </Link>
      //) : null}
      ) : (
      <div /> 
      )}

      <Link
        //   href="/events/austin?page=3"
        href={nextPath}
        className={btnStyles}
      >
        Next
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </Link>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now on the first page "Previous" button disappears. Now we need to make sue the "Next" button is to the right. But because of Flexbox, and the "Previous" button is not on the left, it is not going to balance out the "Next" button for Flexbox. So instead of `null` we should return empty `<div>`, now the "Next" button is on the right side.

### removing "Next" button form the last page

When we eventually go to the last page, we also see the "Next" button where it should be invisible then., there is no more events.

Here in `events-list.tsx` we have this path, 
```tsx
const nextPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page + 1}`; //V246
```
we only want to have this path if there are results to show.

How do we know that actually? Because each page has six results, how many result are going to be there in total? 

This is also something that Prisma help us out with.

Here in `EventsaList` when we get `events` based on the `city` and `page` , we can also see how many total results there are going to be. 

In `utils.ts` it needs to be a separate database query. For Austin for example it can count how many results are there for Austin. We return an object where we have `events`and `totalCount`. Now when we use the `getEvents()` in `events-list.tsx`, we need to destructure `events` from object, and also get `totalCount` form there.

`utils.ts` fragment before change
```tsx
export async function getEvents(city: string, page = 1) {  //V246
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    take: 6, //V246
    skip: (page - 1) * 6, //V246
  });
  return events;
}

export async function getEvent(slug: string) {
  const event = await prisma.eventoEvent.findUnique({
    where: {
      slug: slug,
    },
  });

  if (!event) {
    return notFound();
  }

  return event;
}
```

`utils.ts` fragment after change
```tsx
export async function getEvents(city: string, page = 1) {  //V246
  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {
      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    take: 6, //V246
    skip: (page - 1) * 6, //V246
  });

  const totalCount = await prisma.eventoEvent.count({
    where: {
      city: capitalize(city),
    }
  });

  return {
    events,
    totalCOunt,
  };
}

export async function getEvent(slug: string) {
  const event = await prisma.eventoEvent.findUnique({
    where: {
      slug: slug,
    },
  });

  if (!event) {
    return notFound();
  }

  return event;
}
```

Now we can calculate if there are still events left. We know if there are events left if the `totalCount` is greater than 6 * page we are on. If this is true we want to have this string, otherwise we will have an empty string. If the `totalCount` is let's say 19, and we are on page 3, `19 > 18`, there is one more left on the last page, and indeed we will get there. However what if we are on page 4, `6 * 4` is 24, 24 > 19 (`totalCount` 19), we will get the empty string.

`events-list.tsx`
```tsx
import { EventoEvent } from "@/lib/types";
import React from "react";
import EventCard from "./event-card";
import { getEvents, sleep } from "@/lib/utils";
import PaginationControls from "./pagination-controls"; // <- added V246

type EventsListProps = {
  city: string;
  page: number; //V246
};

export default async function EventsList({ city, page }: EventsListProps) {
  await sleep(2000); // V235 moved here //

  //const events = await getEvents(city); //V246
  // const events = await getEvents(city, page); //V246
  const { events, totalCount }  = await getEvents(city, page); //V246

  //const previousPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}`; //V246
  const previousPath = page > 1 ? `/events/${city}?page=${page - 1}` : ""; //V246
  //const nextPath = `/events/${city}?page=${page + 1}`; //V246
  const nextPath = totalCount > 6 * page ? `/events/${city}?page=${page + 1}` : "";

  console.log(events); // V235 moved here //
  // V235 moved here //

  return (
    <section className="max-w-[1100px] flex flex-wrap gap-10 justify-center px-[20px]">
      {events.map((event) => (
        // <section key={event.id}>{event.name}</section>
        <EventCard key={event.id} event={event} />
      ))}
      {/* //V246 */}
      <PaginationControls previousPath={previousPath} nextPath={nextPath} />
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now we go to `pagination-contol.tsx`, we basically do the same here as before, but this time we will not need an empty `<div />`. We will actually use `nextPath && ()`, because we do not need the else `:` option.

`pagination-control.tsx`
```tsx
import { ArrowLeftIcon, ArrowRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";
import Link from "next/link";

const btnStyles =
  "text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm";

type PaginationControlsProps = {
  previousPath: string;
  nextPath: string;
};

export default function PaginationControls({
  previousPath,
  nextPath,
}: PaginationControlsProps) {
  return (
    <section className="flex justify-between w-full">
      {previousPath ? (
        <Link
          // href="/events/austin?page=1"
          href={previousPath}
          // className="text-white flex items-center gap-x-2 px-5 py-3 bg-white/5 rounded-md opacity-75 hover:opacity-100 transition text-sm"
          className={btnStyles}
        >
          <ArrowLeftIcon />
          Previous
        </Link>
      ) : (
        // ) : null}
        <div />
      )}

      {nextPath && (
        <Link
          //   href="/events/austin?page=3"
          href={nextPath}
          className={btnStyles}
        >
          Next
          <ArrowRightIcon />
        </Link>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now the reason why now we do not see the "Next" button for `http://localhost:3000/events/all` is because this `totalCount` we are getting in `events-list.tsx` in `EventsList` won't work for Prisma, the way we have done it with all

`utils.ts` fragment 
```tsx
  const totalCount = await prisma.eventoEvent.count({
    where: {
      city: capitalize(city),
    }
  });
```

We need to make it work with `"all"`, here in `utils.ts` we cannot use the same solution unfortunately. For simplicity let's actually make two separate calls depending on what the city is. We are going to say `let totalCount;`, if the city is `"all"` then `totalCount` is going to be call `.count()`, else it is going to be `totalCount` `where { city: capitalize(city), }`. Now it should work for both situations. It works for `all` route.

`utils.ts` fragment
```tsx
export async function getEvents(city: string, page = 1) {

  const events = await prisma.eventoEvent.findMany({
    where: {

      city: city === "all" ? undefined : capitalize(city),
    },
    // V244
    orderBy: {
      date: "asc",
    },
    take: 6, //V246
    skip: (page - 1) * 6, //V246
  });

  //V246
  let totalCount;  // <- this
  if (city === "all") {
    totalCount = await prisma.eventoEvent.count();
  } else {
    totalCount = await prisma.eventoEvent.count({
      where: {
        city: capitalize(city),
      },
    });
  }  // <- this

  // const totalCount = await prisma.eventoEvent.count({
  //   where: {
  //     city: capitalize(city),
  //   },
  // });

  //V246
  return {
    events,
    totalCount,
  };
}

export async function getEvent(slug: string) {
  const event = await prisma.eventoEvent.findUnique({
    where: {
      slug: slug,
    },
  });
  // V245
  if (!event) {
    return notFound();
  }

  return event;
}
```
